# Ender3Firmware
I couldn't find firmware that was what I wanted... so I compiled my own ðŸ¤“

To install, format a micro SD card with FAT32 and place the .bin file in it. All you have to do then is place that card in your printer and turn it on. 

Features (that aren't in the official build!):

* Marlin 2.1.2.1
* Z Probe Wizard
* Deploy/Stow probe buttons (found in "Motion")
* For the 4.2.2 Board with CR/BL Touch

If you want a different build (for example: a different board, no bed leveling, filament sensor, etc) submit an issue!
